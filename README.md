# Onyx Reference

An unofficial (i.e. not governed by [NXSF](https://nxsf.org)) [Onyx programming language](https://onyxlang.org) reference.

## About

Target audience includes developers willing to write programs in Onyx.
The reference includes all the Onyx, thus requires a reader to be familiar with system programming and the C programming language standard.
The style is technical, but not official.

## Current state

The reference is currently in early draft stage.
Some sections are missing, other are incomplete, and what's left is already deprecated.
Spelling and grammar errors are inevitable, but will be fixed soon.

The repository is not licensed yet, so you can not do anything with the reference other than read it.
Issues and pull requests are therefore not accepted, unless you waive all copyright and patent claims in the commit message.

The commits history is likely to be rewritten prior to stabilizing the reference.

Good luck.
