== Foreword

The following document is a non-official (i.e. not governed by the Onyx Software Foundation) Onyx programming language reference (the _Reference_).

The Reference is meant for the Onyx programming language end-users, i.e. those willing to commit themselves into development of programms written in Onyx.
The Reference is technical, but it may use informal language and also contain explainations, rationale and repetitions where needed.

The Reference is maintained by Fancy Software, the company behind the Fancy Onyx compiler.
See the reference source code at https://github.com/fancysofthq/onyx-ref[GitHub].

=== The Onyx programming language

_Onyx_ is a general purpose computer programming language inspired by C++ and Crystal.

Programs written in Onyx are designed to be executed on modern hardware.
At the moment of writing, these are classic-processor computers running mainstream operating systems, such as Windows, OSX, Linux, iOS and Android.
Onyx assumes presence of vital modern components such as MCU and FPU on a target machine.
Once technology evolves in order to that another component is considered vital (e.g. https://en.wikichip.org/wiki/neural_processor[NPU], https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Qubit[QPU]), the language shall be updated to reflect the evolution.

Still, Onyx is fit in more exotic environments.
The language features low-level functionality such as pointer arithmetic and easy C ABI interaction; these are often marked unsafe and require explicit transferring of responsibility from a compiler to the programmer themselves.
Wrapping the low-level code into safer APIs allows to perform efficiently while staying on the higher level of mindset.

==== Design principles

Onyx defines the following design priniciples (essentially one).

Reuse as much as possible::
Reusing concepts dramatically flattens the learning curve.
The principle is applicable to all aspects of the language.
For example, a runtime variable, a function argument, a class field and even a template argument all share the same declaration syntax.
Interoperability is almost transparent; C types, C literals and even C macro definitions may be used as-is.
However, sometimes evolution requires greater changes.

Be honestly friendly::
A good friend wishes you the best and he _is_ being honest about that.
Sometimes, a good design requires shift in mind; sometime, it's rough.
Sometimes, explicitness is nessecary.
Otherwise implicit, inferrable details may be omitted to improve the interface.
That's the way technology evolves.

Embrace the ever-growing technology::
Some think that `Int32` is more ambigous than stricter `SInt32`.
Others prefer the punk-ish C approach and name the things without thinking about the eternity we all are having joy for here.
64 bits isn't nearly enough to work with qubits _comfortably_, also https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Year_2038_problem[Y2038].
What seemed unreachable before now is true.
One moment in the future, there will be some `Intstem:[2^32]` notation to denote a binary integer with infinite-scalable radix.
Until then, stay fast and practical.

=== Reference conventions

Compiler::
The Standard doesn't mandate whether Onyx is a statically- or dynamically-compiled language.
It is designed to fit both scenarios.
An application able to run programs written in Onyx is referenced to as a _compiler_ for brewity.
In shell code examples, `fnx` implies the Fancy Onyx compiler.

Compile-time output (e.g. panic or macro output) is denoted with `++=>++`, e.g. `# ++=>++ Panic! Undeclared variable`.
Runtime output is denoted with `++->++`, e.g. `# ++->++ Hello, world!`.

=== ðŸš§ Current state

The Reference is WIP, its development is aligned to the https://github.com/fancysofthq/fnx[Fancy Onyx compiler].
Most concepts are stabilized.
Builtin and standard libraries aren't complete yet, though, their usage in examples is mostly for demonstration purposes.

Currently, the Reference may be too dry and technical, i.e. more of a specification rather than a user-friendly reference.
You can improve that by creating a PR in https://github.com/fancysofthq/onyx-ref.
