= Builtin type

A _builtin type_ doesn't require explicit <<_onyx_source_files, importing>>, i.e. is always globally accessible; it is also likely to have a literal.

Following the general design principles of Onyx, FPU and MCU presence is assumed for a target machine.
Therefore, builtin types include those relying on floating point, vector and dynamic memory access operations.

This section gives an overview of the builtin types.
