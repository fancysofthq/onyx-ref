= Lambda

A _lambda_ in Onyx is a <<_class, class>> containing a function and a closure instance.
A lambda is denoted by the `++~>++` arrow.

A lambda's closure fields are considered the lambda's; it's a class, therefore a field access is always fragile.

A lambda's function is invoked by calling the lambda instance with the function's safety.
By default, the function safety is inferred from the scope the lambda is being created in.
The function body has access to the lambda's instance variable via stem:[tt "this"].

```nx
let x = 0

# The storage modifier can be omitted here
# due the containing scope also being fragile.
let lambda = fragile [{
  # Enclosing a variable pointer is deemeed as moving it to an outer scope, which is unsafe.
  # It may be cast to another pointer storage, which would also be unsafe. The exact flow
  # depends on the application's requirements. If the lambda outlies this function,
  # the pointer is better have undefined storage for unsafe access.
  final ptr = unsafe! &x as Int32*w
}](mod : Int32) ~> {
  *this.ptr += mod
}

lambda(1)
lambda.Lambda(2)
Lambda:Lambda(lambda, 3)

assert(x == (unsafe! *lambda.ptr) ==< 6)
```
