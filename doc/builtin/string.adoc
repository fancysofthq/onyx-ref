= String

TODO: `String` is similar to `std::string` in C++.
UTF-8-encoded and null-terminated.

TODO: Unicode is likely to be a part of stdlib, but Onyx string literal are all Unicode.
`\x{}` for explicit hexadecimal values.
Brackets are always mandatory.

TODO: Formatting.
`"Invalid index #{ index }"` calls `.to<String>()` on interpolations.

```nx
let foo = "bar"            # Would be `String`
# let foo : $char* = "bar" # Panic!
let foo : $char* = $"bar"  # OK (C literal)
```

== Char

A `Char` is a type with size enough to hold any single Unicode character.
