= Variant

> In computer science, a tagged union, also called a variant [â€¦], is a data structure used to hold a value that could take on several different, but fixed, types.
Only one of the types can be in use at any one time, and a tag field explicitly indicates which one is in use.
-- Wikipedia contributors, https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tagged_union

A possible variant value is called an _option_ in Onyx.
Option type ordering in a variant type is irrelevant, i.e. `Variant<stem:[tau], stem:[upsilon]>` stem:[-=] `Variant<stem:[upsilon], stem:[tau]>`.

A variant constructor accepts either a narrower variant instance or an instance of one of its options type (i.e. may be autocast).

.Variant construction
====
```nx
final x : Variant<Int32, String> = 42         # OK, accepts an option instance
final y : Variant<Int32, Float64, String> = x # OK, accepts a narrower variant
```
====

An actual variant instance option value may be extracted with either stem:[tt "@get"] or stem:[tt "@get?"] instrinsic invocation.
The <<_safety, safety>> of invoking an intrinsic depends on the instance <<_storage, storage>>: a local variant instance has threadsafe access, otherwise it's fragile.

CAUTION: You can explicitly obtain a variant tag offset in bytes using the stem:[tt "@offsetof"] intrinsic.

.Variant intrinsics
====
```nx
import rand from "std/rand"
import { out } from "std/term"

# TIP: The top-level scope is fragile.
#

final var = rand(42, "foo") : Variant<Int32, String>

final a = @get<Int32>(var) : Int32     # May throw `VariantError` if it's not `Int32`
final b = @get?<String>(var) : String? # May return `nil` if it's not `String`

# Unsafely get a `String` option.
final c = unsafe! *((&var as void*)[@offsetof(var)] as String*)
```
====

// A variant instance virtualized to an option type stem:[upsilon] allows direct access as if it was a stem:[upsilon] instance.

// A compiler shall automatically virtualize a non-final variant instance within a branch body (see <<_jump>>) if an option determination took place in a threadsafe environment, i.e. there are guarantees that the variant instance won't be altered by another thread.
// A final variant instance is automatically virtualized in any safety environment.

// .Variant access safety
// ====
// ```nx
// threadsafe! {
//   let x = rand(42, "foo") # This is a local variable

//   if (@is?<Int32>(x)) {
//     x += 1      # OK, because `x : Variant<Int32, String>~Int32`
//     # x = "bar" # => Panic! Can not assign `String` to `x~Int32`

//     x~Variant = "bar" # OK, de-virtualize to `Variant<Int32, String>~Variant<Int32, String>`

//     # x += 1     # => Panic! `x~Variant<Int32, String>.+(Int32)` is undeclared
//     # x += "baz" # => Panic! Ditto
//   } else {
//     x += "baz" # OK, `x~String`
//   }
// }
// ```

// ```nx
// let x = rand(42, "foo") # A static non-final variable

// threadsafe foo() {
//   if (fragile! @is?<Int32>(x)) {
//     fragile! x~Int32 += 1 # Virtualization would be fragile, and may even throw
//     unsafe! x~Int32 += 1  # Unsafely virtualize if sure about multi-threaded access
//   }
// }
// ```
