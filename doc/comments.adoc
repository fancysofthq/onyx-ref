= Comments

A comment begins with `#` and spans until the end of the line.

```nx
# This is a comment.
some_call() # This is also a comment
```

A `#` immediately following an identifier is considered a <<_function_tagging, function tag>>; an explicit spacing would be required.

```nx
list.each#indexed() # A tagged function call, `#` denotes a function tag
list.each #indexed() `#` begins the comment
```

== Documentation

Multiple comments without empty lines adjacent to a statement are called _documentation_.
An annotation application between documentation and statement doesn't break the documentation.

Documentation blocks may be parsed by a documentation generator to generate a user-friendly API documentation.

```nx
# This is a freestanding comment.
# It wouldn't be seen in the API docs.
#

some_call() # This is also a comment which wouldn't be present in the API docs

# This is a documentation block.
# It would be reflected in API docs.
@[SomeAnnotation]
class MyClass {
  # This is a documentation for the variable,
  # also seen in the API docs.
  let foo : String
}
```

== Comment styling

[RATIONALE]
====
Enforcing comment styling increases the quality of Onyx libraries.
====

A comment should be written in British (`en_gb`) language, but may contain any other Unicode chars for emojis, names, charts etc.

A freestanding comment should always have one empty comment line appended.
A documentation may or may not have a empty comment line appended.

A non-inline comment should be hard-terminated with an optional sequence of emojis following the terminator.
An inline comment should not be hard-terminated.

Inline comments in adjacent lines should be aligned to the fartest one.
If an inline comment hits some pre-defined length limit, it disables the alignment for the whole block of adjacent lines.

Comments support vanilla Markdown styling.
By default, a code fence block language is Onyx.

.Comment styling
====
```nx
threadsafe! {
  # This context is threadsafe.
  #

  x.value += 1          # Implicitly wrapped in class mutex thus slow
  fragile! x.value += 1 # Fast but not threadsafe

  Atomic.incr(&x) # Increment atomically with sequentially consistent ordering
  fragile! Atomic.incr<:release>(&x) # Increase atomically with "release" ordering
}
```

But this is also valid styling:

```nx
threadsafe! {
  # This context is threadsafe. ðŸ¤—
  x.value += 1 # Implicitly wrapped in class mutex thus slow
  fragile! x.value += 1 # Fast but not threadsafe
  Atomic.incr(&x) # Increment atomically with sequentially consistent ordering
  fragile! Atomic.incr<:release>(&x) # Increase atomically with "release" ordering
}
```
