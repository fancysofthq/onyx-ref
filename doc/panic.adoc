This soon-to-be-standardized appendix lists panic codes with their descriptions.

== P0002

stem:[tt "final"] and stem:[tt "getter"] modifiers are incompatible during variable definition.

```onyx
class Foo {
  # final getter bar : Int32 # => Panic (P0002)!
  final bar : Int32          # OK
  getter baz : Int32         # OK
}
```
