= C scope

C entities (functions, types and even literals) are referenced from Onyx code by prepending `$`.
Multi-word entities are wrapped in backticks, e.g. `++$`unsigned int **`++`.

Builtin C declarations (i.e. those not requiring any ``include``s) are accessible anywhere.
For example, `$int`, `$char*` etc.

A non-builtin C declaration requires current Onyx source file to either include the header, or to declare the entity explicitly.
That means, for example, that you have to `extern #include "stdio.h"` or `extern void puts(char*);` in **each** Onyx source file which calls `$puts`.
