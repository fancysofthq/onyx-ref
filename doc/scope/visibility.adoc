[[_private]]
= Visibility

_Visibility_ may be either _public_ or _private_.

By default a variable or function is public.
It may be defined explicitly private using the stem:[tt "private"] modifier.
It is not possible to access a private member of a scope other than by wrapping the access in some sort of public getter.
A visibility modifier can not be overloaded, only overriden; with an exception for a <<_class, class>> constructor.

```nx
struct Foo {
  def bar();            # Implicitly public by default
  private reimpl bar(); # Now it's private
}

# Foo().bar() # => Panic! Can not access private field `Foo.bar`
```
