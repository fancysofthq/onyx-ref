= Struct

A _struct_ is an ergonomic alternative to a to distinct <<_record, record>> alias.
Akin to record, a struct is passed by value.

A default public struct constructor accepts a <<_record, record>> containing the struct's fields, or zero args if the record is empty.

```nx
struct Point {
  let x, y = 0f
  static zero() -> self()
}

assert(
  Point({ x: 0, y: 0 }) ===
  Point({ }) |==
  Point() |==
  Point::zero())
```

A struct type may inherit another struct or trait.
