= Record

A _record_ is a non-empty stack-allocated collection of named heterogeneous elements, accessible as _fields_.
A record type stem:[R] defines a public constructor which accepts an stem:[R] instance with fields passed by their names.
Also, `Record<stem:[R]> : stem:[R]`.

A record field definition is implicitly stem:[tt "let"] by default.
A stem:[tt "final"] field can not be modified after record instantiation.
See <<_field>>.

```onyx
let rekord = { x: 1, final y: 2 } :
  Record<{ let x : Int32, final y : Int32 }> :
  { x, final y : Int32 }

assert(rekord.x == 1)
rekord.x = 3
assert(rekord.x == 3)

assert(rekord.y == 2)
# rekord.y = 4 # => Panic! Can not modify final field `rekord.y`
```

If a record field stem:[x] has a default value, then it may be omitted in the constructor record.
A record type which has default values set for all of its fields also defines a zero arity constructor.
A default value is not a part of the record prototype, i.e. `{ stem:[x] : stem:[tau] = stem:[a] }` stem:[-=] `{ stem:[x] : stem:[tau] = stem:[b] }` stem:[-=] `{ stem:[x] : stem:[tau] }`.
The _nearest_ default value is applied upon construction.

A record type may be <<_alias, aliased>>.
Recursive aliasing is not allowed unless it's a recursive pointer, e.g. `alias Node ++=>++ { parent : Node* }`.

A record defines the _equality operator_ `===` which returns `true` if all of its fields are equal to the operand's.
`!==` returns `true` if any of the fields aren't equal.
`|===` is similar to `===`, but returns a copy of self if equal, useful in long assertions.
// TODO: `assert(false === false |=== true)`.

```onyx
alias Point => { x, y : Int32 = 0 }

assert(
  Point({ x: 0, y: 0}) ===
  Point({ x: 0 }) |===
  Point({ }) |===
  Point())

assert(Point() !== Point({ x: 1 })) # `x` aren't equal
```

To avoid repetition, a freestanding identifier `stem:[i]` expands to `stem:[i]: stem:[i]` in a record.

```onyx
let x = 17
final point = Point({ x }) # Shortcut to `Point({ x: x })`
assert(point.x == 17)
```

A record type can also be <<_distinct_alias, aliased disinctively>>, which allows its extension and thus inheritance.
A record fields have undefined order, but an ancestor's field are guaranteed to come earlier.
This effectively allows to safely upcast a record instance.

TIP: To ensure memory ordering for interoperability, use C structs instead.

For a record type stem:[R] a static function `stem:[R]::stem:[R]` may be oveloaded to implement a custom constructor.
Inherited fields are available in a constructor record.

A non-identifier stem:[x] (e.g. a call) of type stem:[tau] may be passed to a record constructor anonymously iff the record has stem:[tau] in the list of its ancestors; the ancestor would be initialized with stem:[x] then and merged with other fields in order of appearance in the constructor record (former values are overwritten).

```onyx
enum Color {
  Red,
  Green,
  Blue
}

struct Drawable {
  let color : Color
}

distinct alias Point => { x, y = 0f } : Drawable {
  # A custom constructor.
  static self(x, y, color) -> self({ Drawable({ color }), x, y })

  # A custom method available exclusively for a `Point` instance.
  def length() -> (this.x ** 2 + this.y ** 2).sqrt()
}

# let point = Point({ Drawable({ color: :red }), x: 3, y: 4}) # Too long 👎
let point = Point(3, 4, :red) # Calling the custom constructor 👍

assert(point.color == :red)
assert(point.length() == 5)

final drawable = point as Drawable # OK, safe
# point = drawable as Point        # => Panic! Can not safely downcast
```

A more ergonomic alternative to distinctly aliasing a record type would be defining a freestanding <<_struct, struct>> instead.

[TIP]
====
You can also declare method on a simply-<<_type_aliasing, aliased>> record type using an <<_out_of_scope_declaration, out-of-scope declaration>>.
However, it would declare the method for *all* instances of the record, which is rarely desirable.

```onyx
alias Point => { x, y : Float64 }
def Point.length() -> (this.x ** 2 + this.y ** 2).sqrt()

# Do you really want this method for all of the similar records?
assert({ x: 3 : Float64, y: 4 : Float64 }.length() == 5)
```
