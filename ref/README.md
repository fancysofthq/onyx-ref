# Reference implementation

This directory contains reference implementation for the builtin and standard Onyx library.
It takes advantage of the standard C library (c11); the same approach is taken by the [Fancy Onyx compiler](https://github.com/fancysofthq/fnx) implementation.

The directory contents is likely to be moved elsewhere at some point of time.
